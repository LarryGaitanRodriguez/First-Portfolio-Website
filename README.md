# My first Portfolio Website
## Created by Larry Gaitan-Rodrigue, July 2017

## Note: I edited parts of the original "code" because I lost the original images for the website. Code added was a new link to the pictures and adjustments to the padding, so they look proper. 

## What is it?
One of the more significant early projects of freeCodeCamp, I was tasked with building a portfolio website that will hold my current and future projects. 

## What is it made of?
The project was meant to put to previous knowledge of HTML, CSS and to put to work newer knowledge of bootstrap and its grid system.

## What did I learn?
I learned how to use bootstrap a bit more appropriately. I wasn't missing the ` class="row"` that I was in my first project and I took a better understanding of the column system. 

I also did a bit of research on website layouts. I don't have the exact website I referenced during the construction of the webpage; however, most people would agree its a bit generic. It's okay that it's generic because my  CSS skill at the time would have struggled a bit to make a unique style. That and it was my second page; I have to take baby steps. 

## With Hindsight...
At the time I hadn't corrected the ideology of using `style=""`. It would have been more proper to use classes instead of inline CSS however that epiphany hadn't happened yet. 

Also, the webpage is a bit generic. Its okay for a second website in my opinion; however it lacked some aesthetics that could have put to work my knowledge of CSS. That leads to my third part...

I hadn't embraced a responsive webpage ideology. The website doesn't correctly layout in a mobile setting, and the nav bar doesn't have any links when in a mobile environment.  Honestly, I hadn't realized the idea of creating a responsive website until recently. I plan to build with that ideology in future projects. 

Even with those flaws, I still was excited when I first finished this site. I remember showing it off to friends and my family with a sense of pride. It's not much but not perfect, but I felt I had learned something more.
